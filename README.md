1.	Raspberry Pi Pico: A microcontroller board used as the base platform for the rubber ducky device.
2.	Programming Language: The rubber ducky script, Circuit Python.
3.	Rubber Ducky Firmware: The firmware used in the project is an open-source firmware developed by the community that emulates a USB keyboard and can execute scripts on a target system.
4.	Operating System: The target Windows laptop is running a compatible operating system such as Windows 10.
5.	Kali Linux: A Linux-based operating system used to control and monitor the rubber ducky device and the target Windows laptop.
6.	Antivirus Software: Antivirus software is used to detect and prevent malware and other potential security threats.


The implementation of the above device project involves the following steps:
1.	Hardware Setup: Assemble the rubber ducky device using a Raspberry Pi Pico and other necessary components, including a USB connector. The circuit should be designed and tested before assembly to ensure that all components work together as intended.
2.	Software Setup: Install the necessary software tools, including the rubber ducky firmware, a programming language such as Python, and any other necessary libraries or dependencies.
3.	Rubber Ducky Script: Write a rubber ducky script in the programming language of choice that will be executed by the rubber ducky device. The script should include the necessary commands to inject a reverse shell into the target Windows laptop.
4.	Testing: Test the rubber ducky device and the script on a test Windows laptop to ensure that the reverse shell injection works as intended. This step should include troubleshooting and debugging any issues that arise during testing.
5.	Kali Linux Setup: Set up a Kali Linux device to control and monitor the rubber ducky device and the target Windows laptop. This step involves installing and configuring the necessary software tools and network settings.
6.	Attack Execution: Execute the rubber ducky device attack on the target Windows laptop while monitoring system activity using the Kali Linux device. This step should include verifying that the reverse shell injection was successful and that the attacker has access to the target system.
